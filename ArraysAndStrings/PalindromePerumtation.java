* Problem:
* Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a
* palinÂ­drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
* A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to
* just dictionary words.
* EXAMPLE
* Input: Tact Coa
* Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
